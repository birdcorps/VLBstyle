                <p class = "VLB_p VLB_spacer2">
                Hidden in the woods outside of Monterey, Kentucky, Larkspur Press creates books that are works of art, 
                each one a delight for hand, eye, and spirit. Among the many notable authors and poets who have been published 
                by Larkspur are Wendell Berry, James Baker Hall, Maurice Manning, Bobbie Ann Mason, Maureen Morehead, 
                Ed McClanahan, Frederick Smock, Richard Taylor, and Frank X Walker.

                What we try to do with our craft and art is to publish in a well designed, well made way. Our focus is on the writing. 
                Artwork is used to complement the poem or story. We try to publish an edition that is affordable. 
                In addition to publishing, we are helping keep alive the traditional art of letterpress printing, 
                which is shown in the special editions we issue, along with the more affordable regular editions.

                In letterpress printing, the words are in the paper not on it. All our work is handset in metal type 
                and printed mainly on a hand-fed C&P. Sometimes the artwork (photo engravings, woodcuts and wood engravings) 
                are printed on a Vandercook #4 or on a Washington hand press. We publish mostly Kentucky writers in two editions. 
                The regular edition is printed on fine machine made paper, and since 2005 hand bound at the press. 
                The special editions are printed on Moldmade or handmade paper and hand bound, usually with decorated papers over boards.

                Over the years there have been many apprentices at the press, but the folks now responsible for the work are Leslie Shane, 
                Carolyn Whitesel and Gray Zeitz.

                The Larkspur Press books listed below are currently on hand at Village Lights. Our holdings are updated frequently, 
                and we are able to fill orders for Larkspur books that are not on our shelves but still in stock with the Press. 
                If you seek a title that you do not see below, feel free to inquire with us. Please bear in mind that Larkspur Press 
                books are limited editions by their very nature. In letterpress printing there is one print run of a given title, 
                after which the handset metal type is disassembled. Once the existing stock from that printing is depleted, 
                the title is “out of print” and no longer available from the Press. Already highly collectible for their beauty 
                and the works they contain, they then become even more highly valued due to their scarcity.
