                    <b>Store credit (sorry, no cash) will be issued in trade for your used books.</b> The amount of credit issued will depend on a number of factors: format, condition, subject matter, presence or lack of a dust jacket, availability, and salability. Please bear in mind that excessive wear will always reduce the trade-in value of a book. That having been said, a book in "practically new" condition might have very little trade-in value due to the other above-mentioned factors.

                    <b>Trade credit can be used to pay for one-half (1/2) the cost of your USED BOOK purchase,</b> e.g. used book purchase is $12.00; you pay $6.00 in store credit, the other half (1/2) of the used book purchase price being paid in cash/check/charge. This is necessary to maintain cash flow for store operation and survival.

Books must not be water-damaged or smell of cigarette smoke or cat pee. Heavy underlining/highlighting or marginalia are undesirable. Mold, spiders, bugs, pet hair, and dirt are simply unacceptable. We will not evaluate books that could pose a hazard to the health of our staff or the quality of our inventory.

                This is the small print. Please understand that we might not be able to use all of the books you bring in. We have limited space and strive to maintain a well-curated selection. We operate under the assumption that you do not wish to retain the books that you bring in for trade credit. Having received the books, we will process them as promptly as time permits, issue credit to your account, and distribute them. We do not hold books pending acceptance of an “offer.” Please understand that we are a “mom-and-pop” business, without a support staff. We do not process trade-ins “on the spot.” Processing may take days or weeks. Once we have processed the books, we will issue credit to your account and distribute the books. Books that we are unable to use will be donated to charities, prisons, and social service organizations in our region, or disposed of as we deem appropriate. We will NOT routinely call or email to notify you that we have processed the books or of the amount of credit extended. If we find an item of exceptional rarity or worth among your submissions, we WILL notify you to discuss options. We ask that you promptly return our phone call or email. Items that are not retrieved within one month of such notification will become the property of Village Lights Bookstore unless other arrangements have been made.
