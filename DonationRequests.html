                As a locally owned independent bookstore, we value all efforts to improve our community. We especially value efforts to increase and promote literacy.
            </p>
            <p class = "VLB_p">
                Every year we receive dozens of requests for donations. We wish we could donate to all worthy causes, but we are only one small business and must make choices. We have, therefore, established guidelines for accommodating those requests.
            </p>
            <p class = "VLB_p">
                We review written requests for donations on a monthly basis. Please submit your request prior to the last Tuesday of the month. If we will be able to provide a donation, we will notify the contact person by the end of the last week of that month and arrange for pickup of the donation.
            </p>
            <p class = "VLB_p">
                Please take a moment to fill out our donation request application with as much detail as possible and deliver it to our store by snail mail or by hand. You may provide additional information (brochures, letters, leaflets, donation forms). Thank you!
