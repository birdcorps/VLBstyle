                For every $100 you spend at an independently owned business, $68 will stay in the community. Did you know that when you spend the same amount at a national chain, only $43 stays in the community? When you buy from an online megaseller, it drops to $0. Local businesses like Village Lights employ local people - they hire people who could be your neighbors, which pumps money directly back into the immediate surroundings, and keeps your tax dollars local. All this makes an independently owned business a part of the fabric of your community, helping to make the neighborhood more interesting and unique â€“ buying at local businesses ensures a strong and vibrant community. Buying from local businesses also cuts down on the environmental costs of packaging and shipping, lowering our collective carbon footprint.

                While all that is incredibly important, we ultimately hope that you choose to shop with us because -- well, because you like us. As consumers we have the luxury of choosing where we spend our money, and isn't it important to spend your time and money with businesses that you enjoy and value? As with most independent bookstores, here at Village Lights we work hard to hand pick the books we stock, and we carefully curate our selection for you to shop and browse. We're constantly working on improving our systems, our selection, our store space, our events programming, and our relationships in the community, and we hope that it shows. We're your neighbors, and, we hope, your friends, and we're passionate about what we do.
