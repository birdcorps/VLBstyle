            Members of the Stapp family presumably lived on the second and third floors 
            in the early years of the building’s life, but the original use of the ground floor 
            storefront is lost in the mists of time. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, 
            there were two periods of expansion of the building from its original footprint 
            to the dimensions of the present brick structure. Either in the original construction 
            or in one of the phases of expansion, the building was graced with an Italianate façade 
            and crown, in keeping with the style that was in vogue from the early 1830s to the 1890s.
