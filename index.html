            <span class = "VLB_leadingCaps">The deed</span> to the parcel of land identified as 
            “Fraction, Lot 77, Old Town” was originally held by 
            John Paul, who laid out and platted Madison in 1810. 
            In 1821, John Paul sold the lot for a whopping $100. 
            It was sold again in 1826 for $400. In 1834, Milton 
            and Elias Stapp took ownership and commenced construction 
            of the building that stands to this day and would remain 
            under the stewardship of the Stapp family for the next 38 years.

        <p class = "VLB_p">
            Members of the Stapp family presumably lived on the second and third floors 
            in the early years of the building’s life, but the original use of the ground floor 
            storefront is lost in the mists of time. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, 
            there were two periods of expansion of the building from its original footprint 
            to the dimensions of the present brick structure. Either in the original construction 
            or in one of the phases of expansion, the building was graced with an Italianate façade 
            and crown, in keeping with the style that was in vogue from the early 1830s to the 1890s.

                <span class = "VLB_leadingCaps">In 1852,</span> William and David Stapp established a wholesale 
                boot and shoe business, and, in 1858, William Stapp opened William Stapp Wholesale Boot & Shoe 
                in the storefront of the building on Lot 77 that had become 11 Main Cross. 
                He advertised as a boot and shoe maker and wholesaler. The boot and shoe making 
                presumably took place in a large open space that occupied the rear two thirds of the second floor. 
                It is not known whether the third floor and the front of the second floor 
                were still used as a residence at this time, but William Stapp and his immediate family lived elsewhere.

        <span class = "VLB_leadingCaps">In 1871,</span> Stapp entered the world of retail, 
        and the business was renamed simply William Stapp Shoe Store. 
        By 1875, one C. A. Stanton was employed as a salesman, and by 1879, he had purchased the business, 
        which became C. A. Stanton Boot & Shoe. Stanton advertised as a boot and shoe dealer, 
        and the retail side of the business dominated. By the mid 1880s, the third floor was no longer used as a residence 
        and the second floor was not used in the fabrication of boots or shoes. The second floor became the workspace 
        for W.E. Green, Manufacturer of Rubber Stamps & Stencils, and the third floor housed the 
        Central Union Telephone Company exchange. This arrangement held through the early 1890s.

                <span class = "VLB_leadingCaps">In 1887,</span> to ensure that everyone knew exactly 
                in which direction they were going, Main Street became Jefferson Street, Main Cross became Main Street, 
                and 11 Main Cross became 110 East Main Street. At around that time, two younger Stantons, Charles E. and Robert F., 
                became salesmen for C. A. Stanton Boot & Shoe at 110 East Main Street. In 1903, C. A. Stanton retired, 
                Robert F. took the helm, and the business was re-dubbed Robert Stanton, Shoe Merchant. In 1907, Charles E. reappeared, 
                and the business became C. A. Stanton’s Sons Shoe Store, which it remained through 1957. Along the way, Robert F. Stanton 
                finally bought the building in 1918 and, in 1922, it underwent a major remodel, including a new cream-colored “steel” ceiling, 
                tan walls, and new rock maple floor. The original front of the store was demolished and replaced with what is seen today, 
                with recessed entry, dark green marble lower facings, and Luxfer Prism Glass above the signboard. 
                The front entrance stairway to the former second floor residential area was also removed at this time.
