                Oliver O. Twist (“O” for Orange) arrived at Village Lights Bookstore on July 1st, 2020. 
                To be more precise, he rolled up to the front curb under the hood of local musician 
                John Sheckler’s red roadster. Our ears were assailed with a great screaming, 
                and crying, and yowling. What fearsome beast lurked before our door? The hood was popped 
                open to reveal a tiny, scrawny, ginger-orange kitten. The blisters on his poor little 
                paw pads were tended to, and then a bit of food was proffered. The food vanished, 
                and then came a very polite request (“please, sir”) for MORE.


                No longer tiny or scrawny, Oliver Twist is not skin and bones, in fact he’s remarkably… well, 
                shall we just say… robust.
