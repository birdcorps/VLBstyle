                    We have an extensive stock of used books on hand, so you can call us to see 
                    if the book you need is on the shelf. If we don't have it, we can do an out-of-print 
                    book search for you. If that which you seek is truly rare or collectible, or condition 
                    is important to you, we strongly recommend that you contact us directly to handle 
                    the searching and ordering for you. We charge a conservative fee for the service, 
                    but, as we have the skills and know the field, we can save you potential inconvenience, 
                    aggravation, and undue expense.

                    Or... you can use the <span class = "VLB_redEmphasize">"Search My Books"</span> panel on this 
                    webpage to do your own search among millions of used, rare, and out-of-print books listed on Biblio.com, 
                    an independent used-book search marketplace.

                    If you simply click on the black <span class = "VLB_redEmphasize">"Search"</span> button at the bottom of the 
                    <span class = "VLB_redEmphasize">"Search My Books"</span> panel, a new browser window will open, and you’ll see 
                    a few select items listed by Village Lights. You can then choose from our offerings or click 
                    <span class = "VLB_redEmphasize">“Search All Bookstores Instead”</span> near the top 
                    of that page to search listings from all Biblio vendors. Once you’ve created an account on Biblio 
                    through our website, we will receive a small percentage of any purchase you make.

                    But don’t forget, we have experience and expertise. Just give us a call. We’d be more than happy 
                    to search, select, and place an order for you.

                    <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Biblio.com</span>, based in Asheville, North Carolina, was founded in 2000 and has grown to a team of 13 
                    book people on a mission. Their goal from the start has been to preserve a local business experience 
                    online, with the emphasis on service and community. To that end they have created BiblioWorks, 
                    a non-profit which has helped build 17 libraries in Bolivia, among many other worthy projects. 
                    They were also the first bookselling marketplace to offer carbon-offsetting on all orders shipped 
                    through their site. More importantly, they have maintained the look and philosophy of a local bookstore, 
                    as Amazon has “assimilated” other used book search marketplaces. Shopping with Biblio affords you the opportunity 
                    to support Village Lights while fostering the values of "buying local" worldwide.
