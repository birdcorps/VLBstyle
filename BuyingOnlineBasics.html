                Purchasing books from VillageLightsBooks.com is a great way to support your local independent bookstore 
                regardless of your location. The experience of buying online from Village Lights Bookstore is a 
                little different from shopping in the physical store. Here, it’s not so much about browsing through 
                the sections, but you can search for and purchase a wide variety of books, any time you want, 
                from wherever you are. We’ll also highlight a few of our favorites on a rotating basis so you’ll always 
                have new reading ideas. Here are some helpful hints (if you need them) for buying on the Village Lights website…

                <b>Important Note:</b> First-time shoppers may either click on “My Account” in the Main Menu and create a new account, 
                or dive directly into browsing and shopping, in which case an account will be created as you check out. 
                But... it is highly recommended that you create an account before commencing to shop. Establishing an account 
                requires creating a username and password. If you are a first-time user and, after placing items in a cart, 
                close your browser or browser tab without having created an account, you will not be able to find that cart again. 
                It will have disappeared into the ether... poof!, and your order will not have gone through, although you might think it has. Bummer.
