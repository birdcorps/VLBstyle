                <b>Village Lights opened as a bricks-and-mortar shop in November of 2008</b> We are a quintessential 
                “mom & pop” business, locally owned and independent, and the proprietors, Nathan Montoya and Anne Vestuto, 
                live above the shop. Come visit us on Main Street in the heart of downtown Madison, Indiana, 
                the country's largest contiguous National Historic Landmark District and a Designated Indiana Cultural District, 
                on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River. We are a welcoming establishment that serves everyone. 
                Visitors say, “This is what bookshops used to be like.” DetroitDvotion.com has called our Twain Room 
                "the ultimate in cozy." Discover for yourself what makes Village Lights Bookstore one of the most 
                inviting bookstores in our region. You'll receive a warm greeting from Grrrtrude Stein and Oliver O. Twist, the bookstore cats.
